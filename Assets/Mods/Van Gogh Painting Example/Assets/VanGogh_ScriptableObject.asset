  _itemDescription: "Van Gogh produced more than twenty self-portraits during his
    Parisian sojourn (1886\u201388). Short of funds but determined nevertheless to
    hone his skills as a figure painter, he became his own best sitter: \"I purposely
    bought a good enough mirror to work from myself, for want of a model.\""
